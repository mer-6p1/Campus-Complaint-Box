## 1. A clear description of the project

This project is a web app that lets students share complaints anonymously, view their past complaints, and also read complaints shared by others. It’s designed to help students speak up and help the admins (like school staff or student leaders) solve the problems.
There are two types of users:

•	Students:

They can:

o	Share a complaint (about noise, cleanliness, facility, cafeteria, or other issues).

o	View the complaints they have submitted and see if it's marked as “Solved” or “Unsolved.”

o	View other people's complaints and react with 👍 or 👎.

•	Admins:

After entering a secure password, they can:

o	See new complaints (that haven’t been viewed yet).

o	Check and manage complaints by marking them as Solved or Unsolved.
